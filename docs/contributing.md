# Contributing

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in contributing to Tunix. This guide
details how to contribute to the project in a way that is efficient for
everyone.

We follow
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contributing code

### 1. Propose Changes in an Issue

Before starting on your contribution, please
[check for an existing issue](https://github.com/google/tunix/issues).

For significant changes, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/google/tunix/issues/new) to discuss your
proposal first. This allows the team to provide feedback and ensure the change
aligns with the project's goals.

For minor changes, such as documentation updates or simple bug fixes, you can
open a pull request directly.

All bug fixes must include a link to a
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook or a new unit test case
that clearly reproduces the error.

### 2. Make code changes

To begin coding, fork the repository and create a new branch from main.

#### Setting up a development environment

We recommend creating an isolated virtual environment before installing Tunix's
development dependencies. From the repository root you can run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev]
```

The `dev` extra pulls in the bleeding-edge dependencies we rely on during local
development. If you prefer to stick with released packages, skip the extra and
run `pip install -e .` instead.

### 3. Create a pull request

Once your changes are ready, open a pull request from your branch to the main
branch of the upstream Tunix repository. Please provide a clear title and
description, linking to the relevant issue if one exists.

### 4. Sign the Contributor License Agreement

If this is your first contribution, you will be prompted to sign the Google CLA
after submitting your pull request. You can review the agreement
[here](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).

### 5. Code review

A project maintainer will review your pull request. Be prepared for one or more
rounds of comments and requested changes as we work with you to refine the
contribution.

During review and development, standard CPU unit tests, package builds, and
documentation checks run automatically on every pull request push.

### 6. TPU CI Validation

For pull requests originating from branches within `google/tunix` (including
Copybara-synced pull requests), multi-device TPU integration tests
(`tunix_tpu_unit_tests`) run **automatically** on every pull request push.

For pull requests submitted from **external forks**, TPU integration tests do
not run automatically on self-hosted TPU runners until reviewed by a
maintainer:
1. Once your external pull request has completed code review, a project
   maintainer will apply the `ready-to-submit` label to the pull request.
2. The `ready-to-submit` label triggers the TPU test suite (`tunix_tpu_unit_tests`)
   running against live TPU accelerators.
3. If further commits are pushed to the pull request while the `ready-to-submit`
   label is present, TPU tests will automatically re-run.

### 7. Internal Import and Merging

Once the pull request has been approved and all CI checks (including the TPU test
suite) have passed:
1. The PR will be converted/imported into Google's internal repository.
2. The change is verified and approved from the internal review workflow.
3. The change is submitted internally, which automatically syncs to GitHub and
   resolves the pull request.

**Important Note for Maintainers & Reviewers**: Do **not** click the "Merge" button
directly on the GitHub pull request UI. All PR merges must go through the internal
import and sync pipeline to keep internal and open-source repositories consistent.

Thank you for your contribution!

## Formatting and linting

We use [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink) and
[Pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) for formatting and linting,
respectively.

For the first time you are setting up the repo, please run `pre-commit install`.
Note that this needs to be done only once at the beginning.

Now, you go through the usual flow of pushing code:

```
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
```

Whenever you run `git commit -m "<message>"`, the code is automatically
formatted, and lint error messages are displayed.

If there's any error, the commit will not go through. Most of the times, the
errors are fixed automatically.

Note: Pylint errors are not binding, i.e., your commit will not fail if you have
linting errors. This is because Pylint is very strict. It is, however, advised
that you address most of the errors.

Once you are done fixing your errors, re-run the following:

```
git add .
git commit -m "<message>" # This will not get logged as a duplicate commit.
```

In case you want to run the above manually on all files, you can do the
following:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you want to opt out of pre-commit, you can always do the following (but make
sure you run the pre-commit hooks manually):

```
git commit -m "<message>" --no-verify
```

## Documentation

The Tunix documentation website is built using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and
[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Documents can be written
in
[MyST Markdown syntax](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html#syntax-core)
or
[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).

### Building the documentation locally (optional)

If you are writing documentation for Tunix, you may want to preview the
documentation site locally to ensure things work as expected before a
deployment.

First, make sure you install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by
navigating to your local clone of the Tunix repo and running:

```bash
pip install ".[docs]"
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can navigate to the `docs/` folder and
run:

```bash
make html
```

This will generate the documentation in the `docs/_build/html` directory. These
files can be opened in a web browser directly, or you can use a simple HTTP
server to serve the files. For example, you can run:

```bash
python -m http.server -d docs/_build/html
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the
documentation.

### Adding new documentation files

If you are adding a new document, make sure it is included in the `toctree`
directive corresponding to the section where the new document should live. For
example, if adding a new page, make sure it is listed in the `toctree` directive
in `docs/index.md`.

<!-- ### Documentation deployment

The Tunix documentation is deployed to [https://tunix.readthedocs.io](https://tunix.readthedocs.io) on any successful merge to the main branch. -->
